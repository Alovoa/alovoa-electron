# WhatsApp Desktop for Linux (unofficial)
WhatsApp Linux client built with Electron. As WhatsApp doesn't compile the official app for Linux, here is an unofficial build. 

### Disclaimer
This just loads https://web.whatsapp.com/ with some extra features, but never changing the content of the official webpage (html, css nor javascript). Linux users just can't install any official app, and whatsapp-deskop-linux is running the official web client.

This wrapper is not verified by, affiliated with, or supported by WhatsApp Inc.
